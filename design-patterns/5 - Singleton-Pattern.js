/*
*  The Singleton pattern is thus known because it restricts instantiation of a class to a single object. Classically, the Singleton pattern can be implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. In the event of an instance already existing, it simply returns a reference to that object. 
*/

/*
* In practice, the Singleton pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate others across a system. Here is one example with the pattern being used in this context: 
*/

var SingletonTester = (function () {
 
  // options: an object containing configuration options for the singleton
  // e.g var options = { name: "test", pointX: 5};
  function Singleton( options ) {
 
    // set options to the options supplied
    // or an empty object if none are provided
    options = options || {};
 
    // set some properties for our singleton
    this.name = "SingletonTester";
 
    this.pointX = options.pointX || 6;
 
    this.pointY = options.pointY || 10;
 
  }
 
  // our instance holder
  var instance;
 
  // an emulation of static variables and methods
  var _static = {
 
    name: "SingletonTester",
 
    // Method for getting an instance. It returns
    // a singleton instance of a singleton object
    getInstance: function( options ) {
      if( instance === undefined ) {
        instance = new Singleton( options );
      }
 
      return instance;
 
    }
  };
 
  return _static;
 
})();
 
var singletonTest = SingletonTester.getInstance({
  pointX: 5
});
 
// Log the output of pointX just to verify it is correct
// Outputs: 5
console.log( singletonTest.pointX );

// Singletons differ from static classes (or objects) as we can delay their initialization, generally because they require some information that may not be available during initialization time. They don't provide a way for code that is unaware of a previous reference to them to easily retrieve them. This is because it is neither the object or "class" that's returned by a Singleton, it's a structure. Think of how closured variables aren't actually closures - the function scope that provides the closure is the closure.

// In JavaScript, Singletons serve as a shared resource namespace which isolate implementation code from the global namespace so as to provide a single point of access for functions.

// We can implement a Singleton as follows:


var mySingleton = (function () {
 
  // Instance stores a reference to the Singleton
  var instance;
 
  function init() {
 
    // Singleton
 
    // Private methods and variables
    function privateMethod(){
        console.log( "I am private" );
    }
 
    var privateVariable = "Im also private";
 
    var privateRandomNumber = Math.random();
 
    return {
 
      // Public methods and variables
      publicMethod: function () {
        console.log( "The public can see me!" );
      },
 
      publicProperty: "I am also public",
 
      getRandomNumber: function() {
        return privateRandomNumber;
      }
 
    };
 
  };
 
  return {
 
    // Get the Singleton instance if one exists
    // or create one if it doesn't
    getInstance: function () {
 
      if ( !instance ) {
        instance = init();
      }
 
      return instance;
    }
 
  };
 
})();
 
var myBadSingleton = (function () {
 
  // Instance stores a reference to the Singleton
  var instance;
 
  function init() {
 
    // Singleton
 
    var privateRandomNumber = Math.random();
 
    return {
 
      getRandomNumber: function() {
        return privateRandomNumber;
      }
 
    };
 
  };
 
  return {
 
    // Always create a new Singleton instance
    getInstance: function () {
 
      instance = init();
 
      return instance;
    }
 
  };
 
})();
 
 
// Usage:
 
var singleA = mySingleton.getInstance();
var singleB = mySingleton.getInstance();
console.log( singleA.getRandomNumber() === singleB.getRandomNumber() ); // true
 
var badSingleA = myBadSingleton.getInstance();
var badSingleB = myBadSingleton.getInstance();
console.log( badSingleA.getRandomNumber() !== badSingleB.getRandomNumber() ); // true
 
// Note: as we are working with random numbers, there is a
// mathematical possibility both numbers will be the same,
// however unlikely. The above example should otherwise still
// be valid.



// What makes the Singleton is the global access to the instance (generally through MySingleton.getInstance()) as we don't (at least in static languages) call new MySingleton() directly. This is however possible in JavaScript.

// In the GoF book, the applicability of the Singleton pattern is described as follows:

// There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.
// When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.
// The second of these points refers to a case where we might need code such as:


mySingleton.getInstance = function(){
  if ( this._instance == null ) {
    if ( isFoo() ) {
       this._instance = new FooSingleton();
    } else {
       this._instance = new BasicSingleton();
    }
  }
  return this._instance;
};

// Here, getInstance becomes a little like a Factory method and we don't need to update each point in our code accessing it. FooSingleton above would be a subclass of BasicSingleton and implement the same interface.
