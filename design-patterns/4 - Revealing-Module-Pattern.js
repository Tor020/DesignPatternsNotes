// The Revealing Module pattern came about as Heilmann was frustrated with the fact that he had to repeat the name of the main object when we wanted to call one public method from another or access public variables.  He also disliked the Module patternâ€™s requirement for having to switch to object literal notation for the things he wished to make public.
// The result of his efforts was an updated pattern where we would simply define all of our functions and variables in the private scope and return an anonymous object with pointers to the private functionality we wished to reveal as public.


var myRevealingModule = (function () {
 
        var privateVar = "Ben Cherry",
            publicVar = "Hey there!";
 
        function privateFunction() {
            console.log( "Name:" + privateVar );
        }
 
        function publicSetName( strName ) {
            privateVar = strName;
        }
 
        function publicGetName() {
            privateFunction();
        }
 
 
        // Reveal public pointers to
        // private functions and properties
 
        return {
            setName: publicSetName,
            greeting: publicVar,
            getName: publicGetName
        };
 
    })();
 
myRevealingModule.setName( "Paul Kinlan" );


//  The pattern can also be used to reveal private functions and properties with a more specific naming scheme if we would prefer:

var myRevealingModule = (function () {
 
        var privateCounter = 0;
 
        function privateFunction() {
            privateCounter++;
        }
 
        function publicFunction() {
            publicIncrement();
        }
 
        function publicIncrement() {
            privateFunction();
        }
 
        function publicGetCount(){
          return privateCounter;
        }
 
        // Reveal public pointers to
        // private functions and properties
 
       return {
            start: publicFunction,
            increment: publicIncrement,
            count: publicGetCount
        };
 
    })();
 
myRevealingModule.start();
